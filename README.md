## Updated WUR LaTeX thesis template

This is the updated thesis template, originally created by [Arend Ligtenberg](https://www.wageningenur.nl/en/Persons/Arend-Ligtenberg.htm), last modified by [Lo√Øc](https://github.com/loicdtx/Wageningen_PhD_thesis_template), then Benjamin Brede, and now by me.

Features:

* Bibliography with biblatex instead of bibtex
	+ Compatible with Mendeley exported bib-databases
	+ Separate bib-database for your own publications
	+ Semi-automatic highlighting of your author name in own publication list
* Automatic page counter
* Suggestions for convenient packages: acronym, siunitx, fancyref, enumitem, microtype

Enjoy!
