# Propositions
## This thesis
1. You can make accurate, reliable and useful maps using only open data
2. NOT SURE YET:
- It is important to assess and improve how the accuracy of your maps varies through space and time
- 
- (Trans)national organizations should put more effort in harmonizing different systems that quantify land cover and land use. 
## Science in general
3. PhD candidates should take every opportunity to exchange experiences to maintain healthy perspectives and boundaries.
4. [Something about project pragmatism harming scientific rigor]
5. [Something about needing projects to do science]
6. Many of the acronyms proposed by scientists and institutions are very bad while ‘hogging’ catchy words for more dedicated and authentic acronym-crafters.
## Society
7. Hierarchy - while beneficial for land cover classification - should be minimized in society
8. For-profit corporations should not be trusted as the stewards of any kind of truth.

# Thoughts
Open data is not equally distributed, it has some characteristics that must be overcome.
Global mapping is scientific colonialism; extrapolating data from rich powerful countries to poor countries and enforcing a certain view (legend, definitions)
My method was born in a region that has plentiful open data, and can guide data collection efforts elsewhere.
