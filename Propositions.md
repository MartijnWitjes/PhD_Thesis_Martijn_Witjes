# Thoughts
Open data is not equally distributed, it has some characteristics that must be overcome.
Global mapping is scientific colonialism; extrapolating data from rich powerful countries to poor countries and enforcing a certain view (legend, definitions)
My method was born in a region that has plentiful open data, and can guide data collection efforts elsewhere.
