\chapter{About the author}

As a young child, Martijn used to draw giant maps with innumerable amounts of things on them, even transforming map-drawing into a multi-table boardgame with his friends. Beleaguered by a broad array of interests, he tried out several educational programmes, from entrepeneurship and political science to forestry. He finally came full circle with a return to mapmaking, and from there, remote sensing.
